Lego-Bowling
============

ECE243 (Computer Organization) Final Project

A lego bowling game using a mixture of C and Assembly language. It was specifically designed to run on Altera's NIOSII embedded processor, along with a custom Lego Controller and lego light sensors. A launcher controlled through PS/2 input from a keyboard is used to launch a ball at light sensors. The light sensors detect the ball and the velocity and position is identified. This information is then used to display graphically how many pins where knocked down through the VGA adapter on an external display.
